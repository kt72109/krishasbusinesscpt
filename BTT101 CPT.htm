<P ALIGN="CENTER"> Here is a brief introduction about me:
<P ALIGN="CENTER"> Hello my name is Krisha Thakkar and this is my first E-Portfolio! I am a Grade 9 student at St. Edmund Campion Secondary School. I have many hobbies such as dancing, singing, coding, playing chess, playing sports, and more. A few sports I play are volleyball, soccer, and basketball. I play chess a lot because it is good for my mental health. It strengthens my concentration, time management, and critical thinking skills. I believe that this board game will be beneficial to me and the hospital that I am willing to work for. The image to the left portrays my characteristics. A few characteristics this image shows are confident, stylish, excited, enthusiastic, friendly, loving, caring, and calm. The image to the right is a picture of my lovely business teacher, Ms. Harvey, who has helped me throughout this entire course. I am grateful to have her a business teacher. Love you Ms. Harvey!</P>
